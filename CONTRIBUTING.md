<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Meilisearch [documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [Meilisearch community](https://discord.com/invite/meilisearch). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-js repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-js repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Node >= v18 and Node <= 22
- Yarn v1.x

### Setup

You can set up your local environment natively or using `docker`, check out the [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml).

Example of running all the checks with docker:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm package bash -c "yarn install && yarn test && yarn lint"
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
yarn --dev
```

### Tests and Linter

Each PR should pass the tests and the linter to be accepted.

```bash
# Tests
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh # download Meilisearch
./meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics # run Meilisearch
yarn test
# Linter
yarn style
# Linter with fixing
yarn style:fix
# Build the project
yarn build
```

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:

- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project uses [GitHub Merge Queues](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-merge-queue-is-generally-available/) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to rebase manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases/).

## Release Process (for the internal team only)

Meilisearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

### Automation to Rebase and Merge the PRs

This project uses GitHub Merge Queues that helps us manage pull requests merging.

### Automated Changelogs

This project integrates a tool to create automated changelogs.<br>
_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/release-drafter.md)._

### How to Publish the Release

⚠️ Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md).

#### Version update

Make a PR modifying the following files with the right version:

[`package.json`](/package.json):

```javascript
"version": "X.X.X",
```

[`src/package-version`](/src/package-version.ts)

```javascript
export const PACKAGE_VERSION = 'X.X.X'
```

#### Github publish

Once the changes are merged on `main`, you can publish the current draft release via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases): on this page, click on `Edit` (related to the draft release) > update the description (be sure you apply [these recommendations](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md#writting-the-release-description)) > when you are ready, click on `Publish release`.

GitHub Actions will be triggered and push the package to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meilisearch).

#### Release a `beta` Version

This package is able to create multiple types of betas:

- A standard package beta, working on the latest version of Meilisearch.
- A beta implementing the changes of a rc version of Meilisearch.
- A beta implementing a specific feature `prototype` of Meilisearch.

Here are the steps to release a beta version of this package depending on its type:

1. Create a new branch containing the changes with the correct name format following these rules:
    - `package beta`: create a branch `beta/xx-xx` with the context of your beta.
      Example: `beta/refactor`.
    - Meilisearch `pre-release beta`: create a branch originating from `bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*` named `pre-release-beta/v*.*.*`. <br>
      Example: `pre-release-beta/v0.30.0`
    - Meilisearch `prototype beta`: create a branch `prototype-beta/xx-xx`. Where `xxx` has the same name as the docker image containing the prototype.
        Example: If the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/getmeili/meilisearch/tags) is named: `prototype-multi-search-0`, the branch should be named: `prototype-beta/prototype-multi-search`

2. [Update the version](#version-update) following the correct format (X are numbers):
    - package and prototype beta: `X.X.X-***.X`
      example: `0.2.0-new-feature.0`
    - pre-release beta: `X.X.X-vX.X.X-pre-release.X`
      example: `0.2.0-v0.30.0-pre-release.0`

3. Commit and push your code to the newly created branch (step 1).

4. Go to the [GitHub interface for releasing](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases): on this page, click on `Draft a new release`.

5. Create a GitHub pre-release:

- Fill the description with the detailed changelogs
- Fill the title with `vX.X.X-beta.0`
- Fill the tag with `vX.X.X-beta.0`
- ⚠️ Select the `vX.X.X-beta.0` branch and NOT `main`
- ⚠️ Click on the "This is a pre-release" checkbox
- Click on "Publish release"
